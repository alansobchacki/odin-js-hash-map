Project: Hash Map
=============

A basic app that builds a hash map.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-hash-map/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the tenth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [10/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Build a HashMap class or factory function.
- [x] Build the following functions:
  - [x] hash(key) - takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
  - [x] set(key, value) - takes two arguments: the first is a key and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is updated.
  - [x] get(key) - takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.
  - [x] has(key) - takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
  - [x] remove(key) - takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
  - [x] length() - returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
  - [x] clear() - removes all entries in the hash map.
  - [x] keys() - returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
  - [x] values() - returns an array containing all the values.
  - [x] entries() - returns an array that contains each [key, value] pair.

What I Learned
-----

It may be silly, but I finally learned the difference between Concise Body Arrow Functions and Block Body Arrow Functions. Didn't learn anything new about linked lists or hash maps since I already handled this stuff with Ruby before.

Notes
-----

I added a driver() function to showcase some HashMap functions. It wasn't a requirement, but it felt like a waste not to do so.
